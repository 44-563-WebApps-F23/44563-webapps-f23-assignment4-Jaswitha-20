    <h1>Jaswitha Kalikiri acts in a Play</h1>
    <h6>Hedda Gabler by the Author "Henrick Ibsen"</h6>
    <p><h6>BRACK.</h6>
    Have you had no visitors?
</p>
    <p><h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p>[Closing the glass door.]</p> Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
    of town.
    </p>
    <p><h6>BRACK.</h6>
    And is Tesman not at home either?
    </p>
    <p><h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p>[At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
    shuts.]</p> No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
    expect you so early.
    </p>
    <p><h6>BRACK.</h6>
    H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
    </p>
    <p><h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p>[Turning her head to look at him.]</p> Why stupid?
    </p>
    <p><h6>BRACK.</h6>
    Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
    </p>
    <p><h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p>[Crossing the room.]</p> Then you would have found no one to receive you;
    for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
    </p>
    <p><h6>BRACK.</h6>
    And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
    through?
    </p>
    <p><h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    You have forgotten to arrange one.
