    <p class="Speech">Have you had no visitors?
    </p>
    <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p class="direction">[Closing the glass door.]</p> <p class="Speech">Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
    of town.
    </p>
    <h6>BRACK.</h6>
    <p class="Speech">And is Tesman not at home either?

    expect you so early.

    <p class="direction">[Turning her head to look at him.]</p> <p class="Speech">Why stupid?
    </p>
    <h6>BRACK.</h6>
    <p class="Speech">Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">[Crossing the room.]</p> <p class="Speech">you would have found no one to receive you;
    for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
    </p>
    <h6>BRACK.</h6>
    <p class="Speech">And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
    through?
    </p>
    <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
    <p class="Speech">You have forgotten to arrange one.
