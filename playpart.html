    BRACK.
    Have you had no visitors?

    HEDDA.
    [Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
    of town.

    BRACK.
    And is Tesman not at home either?

    HEDDA.
    [At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
    shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
    expect you so early.

    BRACK.
    H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!

    HEDDA.
    [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?

    BRACK.
    Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.

    HEDDA.
    [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
    for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.

    BRACK.
    And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
    through?

    HEDDA.
    You have forgotten to arrange one.

    BRACK.
    That was another piece of stupidity.

    HEDDA.
    Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
    be back for some time yet.

    BRACK.
    Never mind; I shall not be impatient.

    HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa. BRACK lays his
    overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
    keeps his hat in his hand. A short silence. They look at each
    other.

    HEDDA.
    Well?
